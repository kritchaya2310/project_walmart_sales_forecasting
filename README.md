# Walmart Sales Forecasting 
This project aims to forecast Walmart's sales using various factors such as stores, departments, holidays, size, weeks, and years. By analyzing historical sales data and developing a forecasting model, we can accurately predict sales, enabling Walmart to make informed decisions around inventory, marketing, and promotions.

## Data Collection and Analysis
We begin by collecting and analyzing historical sales data for Walmart. This data should be broken down by store, department, week, and year. We use this data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonal fluctuations in sales.

## Stores and Departments
Walmart operates hundreds of stores, each with its unique characteristics and performance. To accurately forecast sales, we segment stores by region, demographics, and size. Additionally, Walmart's stores carry various departments, each with its unique sales patterns. By analyzing sales data by store and department, we can develop a more accurate forecast.

## Holidays
Holidays are significant drivers of retail sales. We analyze Walmart's sales data around major holidays, such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday. We identify the impact of holidays on sales across stores and departments.

## Size
Walmart stores vary in size, and this can impact sales. Larger stores may carry more products, resulting in higher sales, while smaller stores may have a more focused selection, resulting in lower sales. By analyzing sales data by store size, we can develop a more accurate forecast.

## Weeks and Years
Weekly and yearly sales trends are crucial for forecasting Walmart's sales. We look for patterns in sales data by week and year to identify trends and seasonal fluctuations. We use this data to forecast sales for the upcoming weeks and years.

## Forecasting Model
To bring together all these factors, we create a forecasting model. This model takes into account historical sales data, store and department segmentation, holiday impact, store size, and weekly and yearly trends. We use statistical techniques such as time-series analysis, regression analysis, and machine learning to create an accurate forecasting model.

## Conclusion
By using a data-driven approach, Walmart can develop a more accurate sales forecast, enabling the company to make informed decisions around inventory, marketing, and promotions. This README.md file serves as a guide to the Walmart sales forecasting process, and the associated code provides the tools necessary to develop an accurate forecast.
